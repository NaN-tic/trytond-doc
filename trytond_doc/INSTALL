Installing trytond_doc
======================

Prerequisites
-------------

 * Python 2.6 or later (http://www.python.org/)
 * trytond (http://www.tryton.org/)

Installation
------------

As it is not a real Tryton module, it's not required neither recommended to
install this package with setup tools.

To use without installation, extract the archive into ``trytond/modules`` with
the directory name trytond_doc.

Modify the file tryotnd_doc/userdoc/conf.py.template replacing the variables
substitution for a value. You identify them because appear as'${tryond-conf:X}'
Change the name of the file removing the '.template' ending.

Create symbolic links to the 'doc' directory of the modules you want to include
in the manual inside the 'userdoc' directory and with the name of the module.

Don't forget the 'trytond_doc' because it has the initial file required to
generate documentation.
You also have to create a symlink 'index.rst' in 'userdoc' directory to
'trytond_doc/doc/index.rst' file.

Execute Makefile to generate the customized manual inside the 'userdoc'
directory:
$ cd userdoc
$ make

To help with this tasks you will found in the 'trytonspain/tryton-buildout'
project in Mercurial (https://bitbucket.org/trytonspain/tryton-buildout) you
will find (almost other utilities):
- a Buildout configuration that include a 'part' to configure userdoc config
  file from template. It create the 'userdoc' directory in the root of
  'customers' directory.
- the 'create-doc-symblinks.sh' script to generate links to modules 'doc'
  directory (using the directory structure proposed in the project)
